### Dependencies
Make sure `/usr/local/bin` is in your `PATH`. Install [Markdown][markdown-install] and move `Markdown.pl` to `usr/local/bin`.

### Installing
Clone this repo and cd into the project directory. Type `./setup.sh` in the command line to create the symlinks. That should be it. You can now use tools like `pfs` and `mdview` in any directory.
